Prebuilt binaries are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases).

- Latest release: **v0.4.21**
- Apple AppStore [On the AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/neon-vision-editor/id6758950965)
- TestFlight beta: [Join here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/YWB2fGAP)

## Getting Started (30 Seconds)

1. Install using `curl` or Homebrew (below), or download the latest `.zip`/`.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/releases).
2. Move `Neon Vision Editor.app` to `/Applications`.
3. Launch the app.
4. Open a file with `Cmd+O`.
5. Use `Cmd+P` for Quick Open and `Cmd+F` for Find & Replace.
6. Toggle Vim mode with `Cmd+Shift+V` if needed.

## Install

### Quick install (curl)

Install the latest release directly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Install without admin password prompts (user-local app folder):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h3pdesign/Neon-Vision-Editor/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- --appdir "$HOME/Applications"
```

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap h3pdesign/tap
brew install --cask neon-vision-editor
```

Tap repository: [h3pdesign/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/h3pdesign/homebrew-tap)

If Homebrew asks for an admin password, it is usually because casks install into `/Applications`.
Use this to avoid that:

```bash
brew install --cask --appdir="$HOME/Applications" neon-vision-editor
```

### Gatekeeper (macOS 26 Tahoe)

If macOS blocks first launch:

1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**.
3. In **Security**, find the blocked app message.
4. Click **Open Anyway**.
5. Confirm the dialog.

## Features

- Cross-platform theme settings panel with improved settings organization.

- Project tree sidebar plus Quick Open (`Cmd+P`).

## Changelog

### v0.4.21 (summary)

- Added curated popular editor themes: Dracula, One Dark Pro, Nord, Tokyo Night, and Gruvbox.
- Improved macOS self-hosted updater flow to download and verify releases in-app, then stage installation for background apply on app close/restart.
- Improved updater platform/channel safety by enforcing install actions only for direct-distribution macOS builds (never iOS/App Store).
- Fixed Main Thread Checker violations in `EditorTextView` by ensuring `NSTextView.string` and `selectedRange` snapshot reads occur on the main thread.
- Fixed Neon Glow theme token mapping to match intended palette readability (dark gray comments, exact `#003EFF` string blue).

### v0.4.20 (summary)

- Added iOS editor paste fallback handling that forces safe plain-text insertion when rich pasteboard content is unavailable or unreliable.
- Improved syntax token readability across themes with appearance-aware color tuning (darker vibrant tokens in Light mode, brighter tokens in Dark mode), with extra tuning for Neon Glow.
- Fixed iOS paste reliability regressions in the editor input view.
- Fixed line-number gutter/text overlap on large files by making gutter width dynamic based on visible digit count on both iOS and macOS.

### v0.4.19 (summary)

- Added adaptive theme background normalization so selected themes follow appearance mode (light in Light mode, dark in Dark/System-dark mode) without changing theme identity.
- Improved cross-platform editor readability by enforcing mode-aware base/background contrast for all built-in themes, including Neon Glow.
- Fixed macOS line-number ruler behavior where line numbers could disappear near end-of-document when scrolling to the bottom.
- Fixed iOS line-number gutter sync at bottom scroll positions by clamping gutter content offset to valid bounds.
