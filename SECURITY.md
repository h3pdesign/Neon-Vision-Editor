# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project is currently in alpha. Security fixes may be released in new tags, but there is no long-term support policy yet.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you found a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, contact the maintainer via GitHub with a private report including:
- a description of the issue
- steps to reproduce
- potential impact
- any suggested fixes (if you have them)

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
